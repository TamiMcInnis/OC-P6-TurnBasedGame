# Open Classrooms Project 6 - Turn Based Game

### Hello and thanks for stopping by!

This repo contains *Open Classrooms Project 6 - Turn Based Game*. The purpose of this project was to learn to use **JQuery**, **Object Oriented JavaScript**, and to develop our **UX/UI** skills.

The given tasks included:

* Randomly generate a different game board on each new game
* Players may not start out next to each other
* The board must contain some blocked spaces
* At least 4 weapons of varying power must be placed on the board
* Players can move 1-3 spaces each turn
* Players cannot pass through blocked spaces
* If players land on a space holding a weapon, the new weapon is picked up and the old one if left behind
* At the end of each turn, a player may choose to raise their shield
* When players land in a space next to another player a fight commences
* The attacking player damages the their opponents health, equal to the value of the weapon they are holding
* If the opponent has their shield raised when attacked,the shield will block 50% of the damage but they cannot retalliate
* Otherwise the opponent will automatically retaliate with their weapon
* When any players health reaches 0, the game is over a message appears declaring the winner
